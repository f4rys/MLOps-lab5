    "In this section, we'll implement manual logging for PyTorch models. While scikit-learn has autologging, PyTorch requires manual tracking - giving us full control over what and when to log. MLflow supports autologging for [PyTorch Lightning](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/), but many people prefer or often need low-level control of pure PyTorch. Thus, we will focus on this approach, which also will teach us more about powerful MLflow capabilities.\n",
